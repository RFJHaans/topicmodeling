Topic Modeling Hub
============
This is a repository for literature on and applications of the topic modeling methodology. 
This page was specifically designed for the workshops on topic modeling that took place at the 2017 and 2018 Academy of Management Meeting, but is open to anyone interested. 

Please see <a href="https://github.com/RFJHaans/topicmodeling/blob/master/Output/Other/Getting%20code%20into%20R.md"> this</a> page for a step-by-step overview of using this Github page. 

The set of slides from the various presentations during the 2018 PDW can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/RFJHaans/topicmodeling/raw/master/AoM-PDW-TModel_18_all_v3_1.pdf">here</a>.

Much of the ideas on this page are closely intertwined with ongoing work with the organizers of the PDW, most recently expressed in our article prepared for the Academy of Management Annals. The abstract of this working draft can be found below.

<b>TOPIC MODELING IN MANAGEMENT RESEARCH: RENDERING NEW THEORY FROM TEXTUAL DATA</b>  
  
> Increasingly, management researchers are using topic modeling, a new method borrowed from computer science, to reveal phenomenon-based constructs and grounded conceptual relationships in textual data. By conceptualizing topic modeling as the process of rendering constructs and conceptual relationships from textual data, we demonstrate how this new method can advance management scholarship without turning topic modeling into a black box of complex computer-driven algorithms. We begin by comparing features of topic modeling to related techniques (content analysis, grounded theorizing, and natural language processing). We then walk through the steps of rendering with topic modeling and apply rendering to management articles that draw on topic modeling. Doing so enables us to identify and discuss how topic modeling has advanced management theory in five areas: detecting novelty and emergence, developing inductive classification systems, understanding online audiences and products, analyzing frames and social movements, and understanding cultural dynamics. We conclude with a review of new topic modeling trends and revisit the role of researcher interpretation in a world of computer-driven textual analysis.
